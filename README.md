# CounterApp

This is a simple Swift app written with SwiftUI that uses `@EnvironmentObject` and `@State`, but also incorporates CoreData.

I won't proclaim this the right way to use CoreData with SwiftUI, but it's how I managed to put them together. _Hopefully this will be helpful to someone else!_
